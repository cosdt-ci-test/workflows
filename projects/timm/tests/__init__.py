"""Tests package marker.

Single responsibility: inject the repo root's ``src/`` into ``sys.path``
so that ``from workflows.markdown_doc_test_base import ...`` can resolve.

Framework deps (mistune) are installed by the common quick-start workflow
template, not at import time here.

Why it lives here:
* unittest treats ``tests/`` as a package; the parent ``__init__.py``
  executes before any submodule import.
* It runs before ``tests/test_*.py`` import, which is the earliest
  opportunity to inject ``sys.path``.
